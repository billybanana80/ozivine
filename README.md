> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ...

You haven't installed the necessary packages. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> "Required key and client ID not found"

Content is encrypted and a decryption module is needed. This is up to the user and not provided by this project.

> ConnectionError: 400/403/404

You're most likely being geo blocked by the service. Use a VPN or try the proxy option.

## Credentials:
